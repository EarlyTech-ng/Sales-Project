## Data Source

The SQL queries used in this project were inspired by a tutorial from **Codebasics** and subsequently modified to suit the specific objectives of this analysis. The queries were applied to a dataset simulating sales transactions, including details such as:

- **Market Details**
- **Customer Details**
- **Product Information**
- **Sales Amounts**
- **Order Dates**
- **Profit Margins**
